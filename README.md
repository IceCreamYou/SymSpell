An implementation of the Symmetric Delete spelling correction algorithm.
It is fast and language-independent, but there is some setup cost to construct
the dictionary.

Currently the results are not as accurate as expected; there are probably some
bugs in the port.

Based on [C# code](http://blog.faroo.com/2012/06/24/1000x-faster-spelling-correction-source-code-released/)
and [algorithm](http://blog.faroo.com/2012/06/07/improved-edit-distance-based-spelling-correction/)
version 1.6, originally written by Wolf Garbe.
